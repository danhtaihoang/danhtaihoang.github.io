Dr. Danh-Tai Hoang is a Staff Scientist at the [Cancer Data Science Laboratory (CDSL)](https://ccr.cancer.gov/cancer-data-science-laboratory), [National Cancer Institute (NCI)](https://www.cancer.gov/), [National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA)](https://www.nih.gov/). 

His research focuses on developing machine learning and artificial intelligence frameworks for personalized cancer medicine. Specifically, he integrates big data resources across multiple modalities, including histopathology images, molecular profiling (such as bulk/spatial transcriptomics, DNA methylation, proteomics) and clinical data to predict cancer biomarkers, cancer subtypes, patient survival, and treatment responses.

Before joining CDSL, Dr. Hoang was a Research Fellow (Academic Staff Level B) at the [Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI)](https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/), [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/), and conducted postdoctoral training at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, [National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA)](https://www.nih.gov/), and the [Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP, South Korea)](https://www.apctp.org/). He received a PhD degree in Theoretical Physics from CY Cergy Paris University and [French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS, France)](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs).
